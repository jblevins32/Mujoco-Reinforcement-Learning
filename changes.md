## Bugs
- IMPORTANT Make MRPP env testing code work with animation
- IMPORTANT Get tensorboard to show both reward curves for main and adversary
- MRPP_Env pops up 64 windows at start of training
- MRPP_Env not learning
    - update obs to include obstacles
    - update reward weights
- Tensorboard not updating with discrete envs
- Tesnorboard not displaying names


## RARL
- They assume transition function has errors instead of perfect environment transitions

## General
- Make continuous algs (DDPG)
- IMPORTANT Make RARL
