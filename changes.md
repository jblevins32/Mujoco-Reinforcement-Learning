## Bugs
- MRPP_Env pops up 64 windows at start of training
- MRPP_Env not learning
    - update obs to include obstacles
    - update reward weights
- Tensorboard not updating with discrete envs
- Give control caps to MRPP env

## RARL
- They assume transition function has errors instead of perfect environment transitions

## General
- Make continuous algs (DDPG)
- IMPORTANT Make RARL
- Fix environment.yaml to work in PACE
